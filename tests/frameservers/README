This directory contains shmif- dependent frameservers, individual
instructions on building and use may apply.

complex/ tries to previde an exhaustive test case for all complex
 window manager operations, ranging from popups, to subwindows,
 viewports, dynamic custom mouse cursors etc.

counter/ provides a simple color cycle in a predictable pattern

counter-ndt/ uses a known color cycle and multi-buffering to test
 how arcan selects buffers in multi-buffer mode

counter-rcv/ used as a recipient for feedcopy or recordtarget
 hooked up to a counter as a provider, checks for dropped or corrupted
 frames

clockreq/ needs the corresponding clockreq appl in interactive running
 (use clockreq as connection path) and tests both the builtin clock
 handler for monotonic event delivery and for timers.

iodump/ will print out text representations for received input events
 to standard output, working as a simple debugging tool for I/O translation
 and routing.

avlat/ is the software- setup for latency and buffering testing,
 it cycles a number of colors and matching audio tones in response
 to any digital input event, printing CSV timings for synch.
 Audio is a simple sine-wave managed in a separate thread.

initial/ connects and dumps the initial state set during the preroll phase.

migrant/ will connect to the normal CONNPATH, render a number of frames
 in one color channel, migrate or voluntarily pull its *dms and on
 successful reconnection, switch active color channel
